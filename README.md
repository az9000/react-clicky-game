# Clicky Game

## Preview
This is my first React app, generated with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Assignment
Create a React app where the UI is broken into different components, the components' behavior and rendering is managed using states and props, and where user interaction is processed.

## How to play
The game will render 12 different character images from the great [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) show **Big Mouth**. The player's score is incremented each time a character is clicked for the first time. Clicking on the same character again, will rest the player's score back to 0.
